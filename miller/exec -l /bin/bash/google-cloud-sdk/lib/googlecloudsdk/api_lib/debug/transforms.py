"""Debug resource transforms and symbols dict.

NOTICE: Each TransformFoo() method is the implementation of a foo() transform
function. Even though the implementation here is in Python the usage in resource
projection and filter expressions is language agnostic. This affects the
Pythonicness of the Transform*() methods:
  (1) The docstrings are used to generate external user documentation.
  (2) The method prototypes are included in the documentation. In particular the
      prototype formal parameter names are stylized for the documentation.
  (3) The types of some args, like r, are not fixed until runtime. Other args
      may have either a base type value or string representation of that type.
      It is up to the transform implementation to silently do the string=>type
      conversions. That's why you may see e.g. int(arg) in some of the methods.
  (4) Unless it is documented to do so, a transform function must not raise any
      exceptions. The `undefined' arg is used to handle all unusual conditions,
      including ones that would raise exceptions.
